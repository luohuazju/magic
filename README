Some Ideas to build some interesting projects.

I will introduce them one by one.

1. Small CRM projects for My wife

She sometimes need to buy and mail some projects/gifts for her good friends. She need a system to track the prices, shipping,
expiration date, Online Projects Links, Coupons and etc. Here is the system I design and implement for her in my spare time.

First of all, Android and iOS are very common and wildly used in our daily life. So I design this small system as follow.

1.1 winner-seller-server

This sub system will provide all the REST API from server side, right now, I am using H2 DB to persist all the data during developing.

This is written by Scala based on Spray, Slick and etc. The messages in the requests/responses are using JSON format.

How to run

>sbt run

1.2 winner-seller-web-client

This sub system will be the UI layer based on browsers. I am using backbone JS there. It also consist of jquery, underscore, 
json2, log4javascript, bootstrap, grunt and etc.

How to run

>grunt

1.3 winner-seller-android-client
